## TensorFlow

**Workarounds:**

- Show the graph of saved model,

  ```sh
  saved_model_cli show --dir ./sentiment_model --tag_set serve --all
  ```

- Restore(load) a model

    [Load Saved Model and Predict](https://github.com/AshutoshDongare/Tensorflow-Wide-Deep-Local-Prediction/blob/master/wide_deep_predict.py)

- Restore(load) a model just one time then run(predict) many times efficiently

- Serve a TensorFlow model with REST/gRPC
